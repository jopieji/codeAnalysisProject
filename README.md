### Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- develop a code analysis tool using Git API for Java and a static code analysis tool
- visualize data using CSV and a data visualization API
- practice Java, coding best practices, and working with APIs
- test, debug, and document the project

### I plan on working on this project in the next few weeks. I intend to finish by Feburary 1st, but work and school might impede this. Still, I will finish this project to gain experience and use the professor's guidance.

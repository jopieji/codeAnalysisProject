### Jake Opie

### Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- develop a code analysis tool using Git API for Java and a static code analysis tool
- visualize data using CSV and a data visualization API
- practice Java, coding best practices, and working with APIs
- test, debug, and document the project

### Usage
- run the program with your target repository url when prompted
- users can choose from a list of preset rulesets, some more strict and some more specific
- the project only analyzes Java code for now

### Notes
- You need to set your Github credentials in a file called .env in the root directory.
- Set your Github username in a variable called GITHUB_USER
- Set your Github password in a variable called GITHUB_PASS
- Your target repository needs to be public, or else there will be an auth error.
- ex: GITHUB_USER=username

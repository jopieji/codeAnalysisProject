NEXT:
    - configure checkstyle or PMD to run on clonedRepo
    - CSV output
    - visualization
        excel or google charts
        jfree charts can read data from xml
       error prone, code style, design categories for pmd; can use these for charting



Git API
JGit
Clone Remote repo into local dir: https://github.com/centic9/jgit-cookbook/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dstadler/jgit/porcelain/CloneRemoteRepository.java

- could also post CSV and visualization on repo page? Not sure how it would work


Code Analysis
Checkstyle
-- can be run on all files in a directory
-- https://www.baeldung.com/run-shell-command-in-java to run from shell
-- checkstyle seems to have Java API

PMD
-- using Java API of PMD
-- rule specification needed / configuration via command line
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1844688/how-to-read-all-files-in-a-folder-from-java
https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_rules_java.html
maybe ruleset generator class:

NEXT:
    - configure checkstyle or PMD to run on clonedRepo
    - CSV output
    - visualization



Git API
JGit
Clone Remote repo into local dir: https://github.com/centic9/jgit-cookbook/blob/master/src/main/java/org/dstadler/jgit/porcelain/CloneRemoteRepository.java

- could also post CSV and visualization on repo page? Not sure how it would work


Code Analysis
Checkstyle
-- can be run on all files in a directory
-- https://www.baeldung.com/run-shell-command-in-java to run from shell
-- checkstyle seems to have Java API

PMD
-- using Java API of PMD
-- maybe have user specify files they want analyzed in command line so I don't need to find all classes
    -- could list java files, have select all option
-- rule specification needed / configuration via command line
-- not writing to xml/csv correctly

--> all used as plugin in POM, but
        -- i think it is analyzing my project
        -- not a target project
MIGHT NEED TO USE DEVOPS OR A LARGER PROGRAM
